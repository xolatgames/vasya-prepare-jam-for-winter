#### The Compilers that used for this game:

  For Windows 🪟 : **https://www.mingw-w64.org/**

  For Linux 🐧 : **https://gcc.gnu.org/**

#### Third-party libraries that must have for this:

  SFML : **https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php**

#### For create your own maps:

  Download Tiled The Map Editor : **https://www.mapeditor.org/**

  *P.S: Map parser file is available here: https://github.com/xolatgames/vasya-prepare-jam-for-winter/blob/main/src/MapParser.cpp*

  *you can try to use it for your own projects. It's my development 😉*

  *But in any case you must leave the attribute: "Thanks to xolatgames for contribute!" or something like that...*

#### Roadmap:

  ✔️ Main menu 📋

  ✔️ Beautiful background ⛅

  ✔️ The walking and jumping character 🚶🏻

  ✔️ Sounds 🎵 and music 🎶

  ✔️ Turtles 🐢 , Rabbits 🐇 and Birds 🐦 as enemies

  ✔️ Changing sounds and music volume

  ✔️ Add map parser

  ❌ Create 3 levels at least 🕹️

#### How to build:

  1. Install Code::Blocks IDE -> **https://www.codeblocks.org/**

  2. Download SFML library -> **https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/**

  3. Open this project in Code::Blocks ( The project is located in *Vasya-prepare-jam-for-winter.cbp* file )

  4. Do things in this instruction for setting up project -> **https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-cb.php** *Yeap! It'll be hard for beginners!*

  5. If you wanna build the project on Windows: Download -> **https://winlibs.com/** , and then check setting up instructions for this compiler for Code::Blocks -> **https://winlibs.com/#usage-codeblocks** . If you don't use Windows, or if you don't want to build this project for Windows on Linux through Wine *( https://www.winehq.org/ )* - you can just skip this step 😉

  6. Open **"main.cpp"** in opened project

  7. Click on the gear in somewhere at the top menus *(Build)* , or just press **Ctrl + F9**

  8. Got it! 👌🏼

#### How to launch:

  1. Open your file manager

  2. Go to the project folder in your file manager

  3. Then locate to "/bin/Release"

  4. And launch *Vasya-prepare-jam-for-winter* if you use Linux 🐧 , or *Vasya-prepare-jam-for-winter.exe* for Windows 🪟

**Profit! 👌🏼 Have a nice play! 😉**
